Hey there!
---

Thank you for your interest in helping out with The Hull Seals Lore Bot! If you're reading this, you are presumably
a seal already, as this project is mostly relevant to us welding iron-wielding pinnipeds.

The best way to contribute without code knowledge is to submit new entries for the bot! This can be done in #cult-of-halpy-and-lore on Discord.
Others will happily help you there :)

If you would like to help out with the codebase, send a pull request with your proposed change or contact me on Discord/IRC if you need additional guidance.

For Cyberseals: because of the informal nature of the bot, normal Cyber procedures and guidelines are in effect, but relaxed.
You may use HalpyBOTs naming and tracking conventions if you wish.

*Happy sealing!*
